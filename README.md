Most design decisions were made because of Mads Barnkob and his awesome [website](https://kaizerpowerelectronics.dk/tesla-coils/drsstc-design-guide/) and [Youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/@KaizerPowerElectronicsDk).

Thanks to those who worked on the [UD3 Board](https://github.com/Netzpfuscher/UD3), some of their hardware design was copied to this one.
